            <p>While Katie Lee makes Creamy Kale and Eggs for breakfast, the chefs discuss their New Year's resolutions. They also introduce and prepare delicious dishes to help viewers get dinner on the table.

            <p>In some areas, "fast" is a good thing. When it comes to improving your running or walking pace, completing a dreaded task or even losing weight (safely, of course)â€”well, the faster, the better. Fast traffic, fast money, fast meetings: all good. But when it comes to fast food? Not so much.
